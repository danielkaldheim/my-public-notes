# Neutralino

Lightweight Electron alternative using native browser controls.

Neutralino is a lightweight and portable application development framework. It lets you develop cross-platform applications using JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML and CSS.

In electron and NWjs you have to install NodeJs and hundreds of dependency libraries. Embedded Chromium and Node creates large overhead and makes even simple apps like “hello world” considerable in size. Neutralino offers a lightweight and portable SDK which is an alternative for Electron and NW.js also with many advantages.
