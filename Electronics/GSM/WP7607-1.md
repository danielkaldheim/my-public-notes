# Sierra Wireless WP7607-1

Reliable Cat-1 LTE connectivity for 4G networks with 3G and 2G fallback in EMEA
The WP7607-1 module is part of the WP Series offering a secure device-to-cloud architecture enabling IoT developers to build a Linux-based product on a single module â€“ reducing overall system complexity and time-to-market.

This LTE Cat-1 wireless module is ideal for low-bandwidth IoT applications that require real-time communication along with the longevity and network quality that 4G LTE networks bring.

Delivering up to 10Mbps download speed, many organizations are using Cat-1 networks as a stepping stone to low-power wide-area (LPWA) networks as 4G LTE can provide a superior user experience over 2G and 3G technologies.
