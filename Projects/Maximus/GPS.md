## Adafruit Fona 3g cellular breakout

- Quad-band 850MHz GSM, 900MHz EGSM, 1800MHz DCS, 1900MHz PCs - connect onto any global GSM network with any 2G SIM.
- This is the European Version - with dual-band UMTS/HSDPA 900/2100MHz WCDMA + HSDPA
- Fully-integrated GPS (Qualcomm PM8015 GPS) that can be controlled and query over the same serial port
- Make and receive voice calls using a headset or an external 8Î© speaker + electret microphone
- Send and receive SMS messages
- Send and receive GPRS data (TCP/IP, HTTP, etc.)
- AT command interface can be used with 300, 600, 1200, 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, 115200, 230K, 461K, 961K, 3.2M, 3.7M and 4.0Mbps
- Native USB support - plug it into a computer and you'll get serial ports for AT commands, GPS NMEA as well as a modem (note we've only tried out the AT&NMEA ports on Windows)

**Cool fact:** The Fona also has a built-in GPS.

**Not-so-cool fact:** The Pi can only make one serial connection. Checkout article *Sending AT commands to SIM900 whilst pppd is active*

### Implementation

### Setup

Edit */boot/config.txt*

```sh
enable_uart=1
```

Install dependencies

```sh
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install ppp screen
```

Try it out

```sh
sudo screen /dev/serial0 115200
```

#### Celluar

```sh
sudo -i

cd /etc/ppp/peers/

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adafruit/FONA_PPP/master/fona
```

Open that file to view PPPD settings when "fona" is called.

```sh
vim fona
```

You should see this:

```sh
# Example PPPD configuration for FONA GPRS connection on Debian/Ubuntu.

# MUST CHANGE: Change the -T parameter value **** to your network's APN value.
# For example if your APN is 'internet' (without quotes), the line would look like:
# connect "/usr/sbin/chat -v -f /etc/chatscripts/gprs -T internet"
connect "/usr/sbin/chat -v -f /etc/chatscripts/gprs -T ****"

# MUST CHANGE: Uncomment the appropriate serial device for your platform below.
# For Raspberry Pi use /dev/ttyAMA0 by uncommenting the line below:
#/dev/ttyAMA0
# For BeagleBone Black use /dev/ttyO4 by uncommenting the line below:
#/dev/ttyO4

# Speed of the serial line.
115200

# Assumes that your IP address is allocated dynamically by the ISP.
noipdefault

# Try to get the name server addresses from the ISP.
usepeerdns

# Use this connection as the default route to the internet.
defaultroute

# Makes PPPD "dial again" when the connection is lost.
persist

# Do not ask the remote to authenticate.
noauth

# No hardware flow control on the serial link with FONA
nocrtscts

# No modem control lines with FONA.
