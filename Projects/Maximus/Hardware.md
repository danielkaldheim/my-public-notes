## Raspberry Pi 4 - Model B

The speed and performance of the new Raspberry Pi 4 is a step up from earlier models. For the first time, we've built a complete desktop experience. Whether you're editing documents, browsing the web with a bunch of tabs open, juggling spreadsheets or drafting a presentation, you'll find the experience smooth and very recognisable â€” but on a smaller, more energy-efficient and much more cost-effective machine.
